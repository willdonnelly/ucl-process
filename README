UCL PROCESS
===========

Launch and communicate with subprocesses.

PROCESS-LAUNCH path . args
  Launch a process. Return a process object consisting of a 5-element vector:
    * stdin
    * stdout
    * stderr
    * pid
    * extra data
  The ports are binary by default

PROCESS-STDIN proc
PROCESS-STDOUT proc
PROCESS-STDERR proc
PROCESS-PID proc
   Synonyms to (VECTOR-REF proc [0-3]), mostly provided for code clarity

PROCESS-KILL proc [signal]
   Kills the process. The optional signal can be either 'SIGKILL or 'SIGTERM,
   defaulting to 'SIGTERM if not provided.

PROCESS-WAIT proc
   Wait until the subprocess returns. Returns the exit code.

PROCESS-CLOSE proc
   Close all ports to the process.

SHELL-EXEC strip? . command
   Execute a command with /bin/sh and return a string holding the output. If the
   output ends in a newline, it can optionally be stripped. Uses multiple return
   values to also return the output on stderr and the exit code.

SHELL
   Execute a command with SHELL-EXEC after running the TEMPLATE function from
   UCL-Prelude on the input arguments. Raises an error on a nonzero exit code.
